To whom it concerns, 

Please find the technical task code in this repository, and with some brief notes below. 

A technical task which involves a html / css representation of a sample website.

Notes : 

- I have implemented a sample reconstruction of the site (just the home page, as presented). 
- The clickable buttons don't go anywhere as there was no content to be redirected to.
- I have implemented the scroll functionality on the header so that it only works for larger screens.
- If you're testing out the mobile responsivity on a browser, refresh the screen for each screen size.
- Not all images were supplied to me so I improvised with images from the internet, or tweaking the images on the pdf that were provided.
- The functionality of the page is supplemented with JavaScript - jQuery.
- The responsiveness of the site is limited but is done through CSS foundation library and some media queries.

Thanks for taking the time to view the task and I look forward to hearing from you soon! 

Kind regards, 

Michael
